# Anagram-Game
This game was my very first project while doing my engineering.
‘The Anagram Game’. An Anagram of a word is another word obtained by 
shuffling its letters. For example, the words God and dog are anagrams of each 
other. This is what the anagram game is all about. The basic idea of this project is to 
read words pick a random word from this dictionary, shuffle it and ask the user to 
guess the correct word from its anagram. The user is asked to enter his name and 
start the game. Then, the random words from the list will be given. The user is 
given one attempt to guess the correct word. After each incorrect attempt or if the 
user is not able to guess the correct word then the user is provided with the correct 
word and the game moves on to the next word. After all the five words, the score 
will be given in the last.
This Anagram game is in Python. Module Used – Tkinter() -It is a standard Python 
interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the 
fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter 
is an easy task. Also, the design of this system is pretty simple so that the user 
won’t get any difficulties while working on it
